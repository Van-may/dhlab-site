      <p>Each semester, the Yale Digital Humanities Lab appoints a cohort of Digital Humanities Teaching Fellows who learn how to introduce digital humanities theories and methods into their classrooms. Fellows are selected from humanities departments across campus.</p>
      <p>DH Fellows work closely with each other and DHLab staff to design and integrate digital humanities assignments and demonstrations into their teaching. Prior class projects include a network graph of course syllabi, an Omeka exhibit on Latin American History, and a Story Map highlighting Pauli Murray's life.</p>
