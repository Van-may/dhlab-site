      <p>From 2015-2018, the Yale University Digital Humanities Laboratory partnered with academic departments on campus to support 2–3 postdoctoral associates each year. During their appointments, postdocs both participated in the intellectual life of the lab and also pursued independent digital humanities research that was relevant to their discipline.</p>
      
      <p>Along with receiving dedicated workspace in the Digital Humanities Lab, postdoctoral associates also had the opportunity to collabroate with a faculty mentor from their home department, as well as technical staff, including a Digital Humanities Developer and User Experience Designer.</p>
