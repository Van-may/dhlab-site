      The "Narrating the Lives of Refugees" course drew upon the the emerging field of critical refugee studies in order to critically analyze contemporary representations of refugee experiences across genres and to help students develop narrative strategies which represent refugees as agents and historical actors. Students paid special attention to the processes by which war, colonialism, displacement, encampment, gender, and racialization shape the lives of refugees in New Haven and beyond. The students took this knowledge and conducted their own interviews with people with refugee status living in New Haven. In the process, students learned to use digital tools like Story Maps to create compelling, multidimensional stories about the people they interviewed. Fall 2017

Students learned how to use network visualization tools, topic mapping, and trend visualization software — as well as a few digital tools by which they can create their own countercultural projects — to better understand the relationship between what runs against mainstream culture, and the mainstream culture that has a tendency to absorb it.
