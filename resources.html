    <p>The Digital Humanities Lab offers individual and group consultations for digital humanities projects at any stage of development, from conceptualization through implementation. Staff address questions related to best practices, data management, corpus creation, visualizations, digital tools, and more. In addition to scheduled meetings, the DHLab also offers weekly Office Hours as another opportunity to discuss projects or general digital humanities ideas.</p>

    <p>Looking to start a digital project but don't know where to begin? Need recommendations on programming languages or visualization fundamentals? Stop by the Digital Humanities Lab during open Office Hours to chat with our team over coffee.</p>
 
    <p>Office Hours provide a weekly opportunity to exchange ideas, discuss methods, and form connections with colleagues from different programs and departments. If you are interested in sharing your work in the form of a 10-minute lightning talk at the beginning of an Office Hours, <a href='mailto:dhlab.yale.edu'>email the DHLab</a>.</p>
 
    <p>Whether you are new to the field and would like to learn more, have an existing project and seek a communal workspace, or are somewhere in between, we invite you to stop by!</p>

    <p>Whenever possible, the Yale University Library works with database vendors to include text and data mining (TDM) rights in license agreements. This means that for some databases (generally ones with out-of-copyright materials), Yale researchers can access the raw text for the purposes of data mining.</p>

    <p>Yaleâ€™s world-class collections offer unparalleled source material for humanistic inquiries. With the launch of the Digital Humanities Lab in fall 2015, we can now push these inquiries further by incorporating digital methods that allow us to see our (literary, historical, cultural, artistic) data at new scales.</p>

    <p>The DHLab supports faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates on a broad range of digital humanities undertakings. Possible digital methods include but are not limited to text-tagging, mapping, network analysis, and topic modeling.</p>
