Yaleâ€™s world-class collections offer unparalleled source material for humanistic inquiries. With the increasing support for digital scholarship on campus, scholars can now push these inquiries even further by incorporating digital methods to study literary, historical, cultural, and artistic data at new scales.

The newly renovated Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab) is especially equipped to support such investigations. An open, communal workspace, the DHLab contains dual-boot computers with specialized software for text, image, network, and spatial analysis. High-definition monitors and an expanding Digital Humanities Reference Collection with books on theoretical and hands-on approaches to computational analysis line the room and are available for researchers to use. 

The glass Special Projects Cube near the center of the lab contains equipment designed for high-performance humanities computing. Researchers who have been awarded a DHLab grant can request access to a machine in the Cube to work on their digital humanities project during the grant period.
