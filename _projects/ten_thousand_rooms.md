### Overview
*The Ten Thousand Rooms Project* is an initiative to build an openâ€“access platform to enable textual work on pre-modern Chinese sources (circa 13 c. BCE to the 20th century). Building upon the Canvas Viewer developed by Stanford University with support from the Mellon Foundation and supported by YDC2 at Yale, the platform would be a shared workspace to allow users to upload images or digitized texts and crowdsource their transcription, translation, and annotation. In addition to the scholarly contributions of the project, *Ten Thousand Rooms* will further leverage and develop the tools of digital scholarship in the humanities introduced by the <a href='http://ydc2.yale.edu/research-support/digitally-enabled-scholarship-medieval-manuscripts' target='_blank'>*Digitally Enabled Scholarship with Medieval Manuscripts* (DESMM)</a> project.
