### Overview

*Digital Editing and the Medieval Manuscript Roll* (DEMMR) represents a collaborative effort in the study of medieval manuscript rolls, scrolls, and fragments, along with the digital tools that can help to facilitate this study. 

DEMMR has conducted a series of workshops at and beyond Yale. Training goals include digital editing and TEI markup, the paleography and codicology of medieval rolls and fragments, and project-based collaboration in the digital arena. These strands combine in the design of the workshops: participants work closely with one another to transform newly learned skills into a concrete digital artifact, and so prepare themselves to take on future digital collaborations.

*Digital Editing and the Medieval Manuscript Roll has been awarded Yale Digital Humanities Lab Workshop and Software Development Grants to support both training events and also the development of a tool for viewing the TEI-encoded manuscripts.*
