### Overview

The forthcoming *Passages to Freedom: Worlding the North American Slave Narrative* project maps the routes taken by the authors of autobiographical slave narratives that were published before 1865. The site uses data from the University of North Carolinaâ€™s North American Slave Narrative collection and currently displays 22 of the 103 pre-1865 narratives.

*Work on this project began during Schroeder's postdoctoral associate appointment with the Yale Digital Humanities Lab.*
