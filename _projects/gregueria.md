### Overview

*La Greguería Virtual, or the Virtual Aphorisms of Ramón Gómez de la Serna*, is an online tool that allows scholars and the general public to search a database of 10,000 greguerías (Gómez de la Serna's aphorisms) using various filters or criteria, including specific words, length, and theme. 

*This project was funded with Yale Digital Humanities Lab Corpus Creation and Software Development Seed Grants to first digitize and tag the texts and then to build a platform for interacting with the aphorisms.*
