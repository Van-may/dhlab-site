### Overview

A team under the leadership of Professor Anders Winroth worked on new editions of the two recensions of Gratian’s *Decretum* with support of the <a href='https://news.yale.edu/2012/12/10/mellon-grant-yale-helps-scholars-create-new-digital-tools-study-medieval-manuscripts' target='_blank'>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, Yale University, and the Stephan Kuttner Institute of Medieval Canon Law, with assistance from Yale Digital Collections Center. The new editions aimed to replace Emil Friedbergs 1879 edition of the second recension through a fresh collation of the most important manuscripts and a reconsideration of Gratian’s sources (both material and formal).
