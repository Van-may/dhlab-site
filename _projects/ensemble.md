### Overview

*Ensemble @ Yale* is an experiment with crowdsourced transcriptions of 90 years of programs from the Yale School of Drama, Yale Repertory Theatre, and other theatrical groups on campus. The project enlists users to extract crucial relationship information from programs: which actors and directors worked together? which playwrights' works have been produced the most often on campus? which actors have played major roles onstage at Yale? Simple optical character recognition (OCR) cannot discover such complex semantic relationships, but human users can do so while they browse through the archive.


### Methods &amp; Tools

*Ensemble @ Yale* would not be possible without the pioneering *Ensemble* software, a project of <a href='https://www.nypl.org/collections/labs' target='_blank'>NYPL Labs</a> and <a href='https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa' target='_blank'>The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts</a>. We are thankful to the New York Public Library for their advice, efforts, and expertise.
