### Overview

*The Works of Jonathan Edwards Online* is a digital learning environment for research, education, and publication that presents all of Edwards’s writings along with helpful editorial materials to allow the reader to examine Edwards’s thoughts in incredibly powerful, useful ways.

Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758)—pastor, revivalist, Christian philosopher, missionary, and college president—is widely regarded as North America’s greatest theologian. He is the subject of intense scholarly interest because of his significance as an historical figure and the profound legacy he left on America’s religious and intellectual landscapes. His writings are being consulted at a burgeoning rate by religious leaders, pastors, and churches worldwide because of the fervency of Edwards’s message and the acumen with which he appraised religious experience. Yet for centuries, scholars and readers of Edwards have had to rely on inaccurate and partial versions of his writings. *The Works of Jonathan Edwards*, the critical edition of Edwards’s writings, was created at Yale University in 1953 to overcome these obstacles.

But even with the Edwards Works amounting to a 26-volume letterpress series, less than half of Edwards’s total writings was available. To provide the entirety of Edwards’s corpus on a global basis, we have created the *Works of Jonathan Edwards Online* (WJE Online), a digital environment that supports and assists the research, reading, and teaching of Edwards’s writings, primarily through a comprehensive, searchable online database that contains the series published by Yale University Press but also tens of thousands of pages of unpublished, computerized transcripts–sermons, notebooks, essays, letters, and personalia–that the Jonathan Edwards Center has on file. Complementing these primary texts are reference works, secondary works, and chronologies, along with audio, video, and visual sources.
