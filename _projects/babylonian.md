### Overview

This project extends research methods and supports didactic objectives associated with the Yale Babylonian Collection, which contains the largest assemblage of cuneiform tablets, seals, and other inscribed artifacts documenting life in Ancient Mesopotamia in the United States. A major aim of the project is to produce and openly disseminate extensive documentation of cuneiform tablets for research applications focused on translating narratives, deciphering meaning, and producing scholarship on Old Assyrian, mathematical, and Late Babylonian texts.
