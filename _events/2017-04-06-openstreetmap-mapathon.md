Many of the places where natural disasters and health crises occur are literally "missing" from the map, and responders lack the information to properly provide relief. Learn how to contribute to responders' efforts with OpenStreetMap. We will introduce the platform, teach web mapping skills, and then  work with participants to map infrastructure in high-priority areas for local humanitarian efforts.

This event is open to everyone, from beginners to advanced mappers. Bring a laptop.

Food and drinks will be provided!

*The Mapathon at Yale, a partnership between The Spatial Collective, Missing Maps, and the Yale Digital Humanities Lab, supports the work of the Red Cross, Médecins Sin Frontières, and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.*
