Discover how machine learning methods can aid in data analysis. This workshop will offer a light introduction to machine learning using the Python programming language. In particular, we will highlight methods that can:

  - classify data points
  - visualize high-dimensional datasets
  - measure distances in high-dimensional spaces
  - identify outliers in a dataset, and
  - cluster similar data points together.

We will focus on gaining an intuitive understanding of the way particular machine learning algorithms work in order to help prepare researchers for integrating machine learning into their own research.

No prior programming experience is required, but attendees are encouraged to bring laptops that have the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6 installed.

All Yale students, faculty, and staff are invited to attend. This workshop is being offered as part of the <a href='https://research.computing.yale.edu/' target='_blank'>Yale Center for Research Computing</a> (YCRC) User Group series. 

Instructor: Douglas Duhaime (DHLab)

This workshop will not be recorded.
