During Office Hours, Jonathan Manton, the Music Librarian for Access Services, will present on the <a href='http://www.transforming-musicology.org/dlfm2016/' target='_blank'>Digital Libraries for Musicology</a> (DLfM) workshop, which was held at the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media on August 12. Highlighting cutting-edge methods for retrieving, analyzing, and interacting with musical data on small and mass scales (such as encoded online scores), Jonathan will speak to wider ongoing discussions surrounding Musical Information Retrieval (MIR) â€” research at the cross section of libraries, musicology, and digital humanities.

The Digital Libraries for Musicology (DLfM) workshop provides a forum for discussions on Music Digital Library systems, including:
 * the challenges of working with the multiple representations of music across large-scale digital collections (such as the Internet Archive and HathiTrust)
 * intersections with conversations around "linked data" and "big data"
 * to consider the suitability of existing Music Digital Libraries, particularly in light of new methods and applications emerging from musicology
 * the potential for Optical Music Recognition

All are welcome! Coffee and tea will be provided.
