Learn how to work with data in ArcGIS! Register for this meetup if you have some familiarity with GIS and would like to become more familiar by identifying patterns in humanities data using ArcGIS. We will provide sample data, but participants should also feel free to bring their own.

Lab computers and <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxrxNM6MZSLSdUhiN1FLSFFTekE/view' target='_blank'>sample data</a> will be provided.

Space for the meetup is limited.

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (DHLab) and Miriam Olivares (GIS)
