When you start on research projects, fair use might not be something you think about. Yale University Library subscribes to and licenses thousands of resources for academic use. While these resources are available to Yale students, faculty, and staff, there are legal restrictions when it comes to how they may be used. 

In this talk, we will discuss how to use databases, articles, and data more generally for both large and small projects. We will highlight past projects, best practices for both text-based and numeric research questions, and easy ways to get help.

All are invited to attend.

Presenters: Catherine DeRose (DHLab), Joshua Dull (DSS), Barbara Esty (CSSSI), Peter Leonard (DHLab)
