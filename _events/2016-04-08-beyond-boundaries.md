What does computer-generated poetry look like? How can EEG experiments inform our understandings of musical compositions? To explore these questions and more, join the Digital Humanities Lab and <a href='http://steamwith.us/YaleSTEAM.html' target='_blank'>Yale STEAM</a> for a spring symposium to showcase hybrid scholarship at Yale University. Undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff will present projects that highlight the questions that can be asked and explored via digital methods and collaborations between the sciences and humanities.

The symposium is open to the entire Yale community and public. Coffee and refreshments will be provided.
