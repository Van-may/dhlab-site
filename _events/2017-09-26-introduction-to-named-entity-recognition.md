  This workshop will introduce participants to Named Entity Recognition (NER), or the process of algorithmically identifying people, locations, corporations, and other classes of nouns in text corpora. We will help users install and run Stanford's flagship CoreNLP (Natural Language Processing) toolkit to identify entities in text files.

This workshop will introduce participants to Named Entity Recognition (NER), or the process of algorithmically identifying people, locations, corporations, and other classes of nouns in text corpora. We will help users install and run Stanford's flagship CoreNLP (Natural Language Processing) toolkit to identify entities in text files. Participants are encouraged to bring a small collection of documents they want to analyze during this session; sample data will also be available for use.

Registration is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited.

Windows machines will be available for use, but participants may also work from Mac or Windows laptops, so long as they have administrative control over them.

Instructor: Douglas Duhaime
