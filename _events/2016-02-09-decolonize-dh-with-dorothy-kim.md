### "How to #DeColonize the Digital Humanities: or A Practical Guide to Making #DH Less White"
*Tuesday, February 9 at 6:00-7:30pm*
*William L. Harkness Hall (WLH), 309*

Drawing from digital humanities (DH) subfields including postcolonial, queer, critical race, disability, radical librarianship, and digital pedagogy, Dorothy Kim argued for making space for broader perspectives in DH to bring otherwise marginalized voices to the fore. Her talk was based on the forthcoming volume *Disrupting Digital Humanities* (editors Dorothy Kim and Jesse Stommel).

This talk was Part One of the "Digital Non-Neutrality Series: Decolonizing and Queering DH Tools and Practices," co-organized by T.L. Cowan (MacMillan, DHLab &amp; WGSS) and Marijeta Bozovic (Slavic Languages and Literatures).

Sponsored by the Yale DH Lab, Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Mellon-funded Re-imagining Digital Humanities at Yale program with Laura Wexler and Inderpal Grewal, and The Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale, and the Canadian Studies Committee.
