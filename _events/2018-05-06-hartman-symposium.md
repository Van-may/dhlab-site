Three scholars will speak on their work with the <a href='https://web.library.yale.edu/testimonies' target='_blank'>Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies</a> at the first Geoffrey H. Hartman Fellowship Symposium.

- Sarah Garibova, inaugural Hartman Fellow, will present her work on an annotated critical edition of Lubov N.'s (HVT-3280) testimony. Lubov was born in Zvenigorodka in 1921. Garibova received her PhD in history from the University of Michigan.

- Glenn Dynner, Senior Research Scholar at the Fortunoff Archive last year, will present his work on an annotated critical edition of Rubin P.'s (HVT-3038) testimony. Rubin was born in Dyatlovo (Zhetel) in 1924. Dynner is a Professor of Religion at Sarah Lawrence College.

- Gabor Toth, Fortunoff and Digital Humanities Lab Postdoctoral Associate, will present his work to build a digital tool to explore thousands of transcripts of survivor testimonies, along with an anthology of survivor experiences. Toth graduated with his PhD in history from Oxford University.

The symposium and fellowship program were established in honor of the late Geoffrey H. Hartman, an eminent professor of comparative literature at Yale and longtime faculty advisor to the Fortunoff Archive, whose vision and leadership shaped the Fortunoff Archive as it is today.

This event is open to the public.
