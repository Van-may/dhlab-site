The Yale Digital Humanities Lab and ITS are looking for volunteers to try out *John Ashbery’s Nest*, a website centered around a virtual tour of the Victorian home of American poet, art critic, and collector, John Ashbery. We are seeking users to test the usability of the website, particularly the interactive experience of the Center Hall, which includes unique objects from Ashbery’s collections.

Participation is open to the entire Yale community. User testing will take no more than thirty minutes. We welcome participants from all disciplinary backgrounds; no specific technical or subject matter expertise is required.

Interested participants should contact Julie Ramaccia: [julie.ramaccia@yale.edu](mailto:julie.ramaccia@yale.edu)
