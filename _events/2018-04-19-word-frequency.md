  One of the benefits of digital humanities methods is the ability to study texts at scale. But what do these methods look like in practice? In this talk, Gabor Toth will discuss approaches to tracking word frequencies.
---
Gabor Toth will discuss approaches to tracking word frequencies across small and large collections of corpora using Wilkie Collins's *The Moonstone* and texts in *Early English Books Online* (EEBO) as examples.

Attendees will learn about the mathematical bases of frequency and will be introduced to different types of frequency (relative, absolute, document, inverse, etc.).

### Series Information
This is part one of a two-part series that will offer a concise introduction to word frequency and collocation analysis for the purpose of literary studies. With *The Moonstone*, *Early English Books Online* (EEBO), and Health Reports from London (1850 - 1973) as case studies, the overall goal of the two talks is to demonstrate how quantitative methods can help inform exploratory text analysis.

Attendees are invited to attend either or both sessions!

### Bio
Gabor Toth is a Postdoctoral Associate with the Yale Digital Humanities Lab, Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, and History.
