Rapid Prototyping Grants support focused design and development interventions to help a digital humanities project get started or to add an innovative feature to an existing project. These grants are intended to produce prototypes in the truest sense of the word: something that is the first of its kind and is a working model rather than a production-ready system. 

For more information and to apply, please visit the <a href='http://dhlab.yale.edu/awards/rapid-prototyping.html' target='_blank'>RPG webpage</a>. Applications are due May 3, 2019.

We will be holding RPG Office Hours on April 16 and April 30 from 2:00â€“3:00 p.m.
