The University of Rhode Island's student chapter of the American Library Association visited the DHLab on March 15 for a conversation on emerging opportunities for library professionals who work in and alongside DH. After a tour of the space, the visiting scholars sat down with [Allen Townsend](http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=1) (the Associate University Librarian for Arts and Humanities), [Peter Leonard]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.html) (the DHLab's Director), and [Catherine DeRose]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.html) (the DHLab's Outreach Manager) to discuss a range of DH projects, methodologies, and training opportunities.
