Get familiar with the command line at the DHLab's next Coffee and Code Workshop! During the workshop, participants will learn the basics of the command line, including how to:

 * create, edit, and move files and directories
 * ssh (secure shell) to remote servers
 * navigate a computer's file system and more!

Windows computers will be available for use, though participants are welcome to bring their own computer (Windows or Mac).

**If you plan to use one of the available Windows machines, please arrive 5 minutes early to the workshop as they take a while to boot up.**

Registration is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited. No prior programming experience is required.

This workshop will be lead-in to our Intro to Git Coffee and Code on October 25 - keep an eye on our website for more information.
