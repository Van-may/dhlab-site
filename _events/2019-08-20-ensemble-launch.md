### Overview
Celebrate the re-launch of Ensemble@Yale and enjoy demos, snacks, and trivia on Yale theater!

Ensemble@Yale is a volunteer-based transcription project to collect the names of actors and staff members from over 900 programs from Yale's theater history.

In summer 2019, the Ensemble team switched to <a href='https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/haasarts/ensemble-at-yale/' target='_blank'>Zooniverse's Project Builder platform</a>, now providing volunteers with a way to track contributions to the project and discuss interesting finds made along the way. Learn about these new features and more at the re-launch party.

All are invited to attend!

### About the Project
Ensemble@Yale is an experiment that aims to answer questions about Yale's theater history by transforming historical programs into searchable text via crowdsourced transcription.

Get a sneak peek of the project prior to the re-launch party by visiting the updated <a href='http://ensemble.yale.edu/#/about' target='_blank'>Ensemble@Yale site</a>!

*Ensemble@Yale is a collaboration between the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory and Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library.*
