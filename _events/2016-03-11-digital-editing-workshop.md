### Digital Editing and the Medieval Manuscript Roll
*Sterling Memorial Library, March 11 &amp; 12*

The Digital Humanities Lab co-sponsored a paleography and text encoding workshop that was led by English PhD candidates Anya Adair and Joseph Stadolnik. Catherine DeRose, the Outreach Manager for the DHLab, gave a guest lecture on digital tools and methods for studying literature. Graduate students from across the country participated in the workshop. Together, they learned to catalog, transcribe, comment on, and mark up (according to TEI standards) two medieval manuscript rolls from the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library's collection.
