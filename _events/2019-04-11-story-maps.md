### Story Maps: The Basics
10:00-11:00 a.m. OR 3:00-4:00 p.m.  

Story maps, which combine maps and multimedia content to enable web-based storytelling, are an increasingly popular tool for researchers. They’re being used to communicate complicated analyses, final projects, and even visual resumes. In this session, you will learn the ABCs of story maps, including what they are and how their builder functions make it possible to easily create rich multimedia narratives. You will also learn about ArcGIS StoryMaps, a new, next-generation storytelling tool that makes it even easier to create maps and weave them into stories.

### Story Maps: A Hands-On Workshop
11:00-11:30 a.m. OR 4:00-4:30 p.m.

Bring your story ideas, and members of Esri’s story maps team will show you, step by step, how to assemble a multimedia narrative. You’ll learn the ropes of Esri’s storytelling app, including tips and tricks to make your graphics pop and engage your audience. You’ll find out how easy it is to create your own story, and how quickly you can elevate your work.

Instructors: Allen Carroll (Esri), Ross Donihue (Esri), Esri, and Miriam Olivares (Yale CSSSI)
