### Overview

Curious about Python but not sure where to start? This workshop will introduce the basics of programming in Python. Participants will learn how to perform common tasks in Python in order to build familiarity with the language's syntax and best practices.

In particular, we will cover:
- writing & running Python scripts
- finding & importing Python libraries
- using built-in functions to perform tasks.

Designed for participants who have no prior programming experience, this workshop will serve as a foundation for upcoming DHLab workshops on text and data mining.

Instructor: Joshua Dull (DHLab)

### Registration
This workshop is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited. To register, visit the <a href='https://schedule.yale.edu/event/5749870' target='_blank'>YUL Instruction Calendar</a>. 

Participants are required to bring a laptop with <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/' target='_blank'>Anaconda 3.7</a> already installed to the workshop. If you have trouble with the installation, stop by the Digital Humanities Lab's Office Hours, Monday through Thursday at 3:00 p.m. for help.

### Follow-Up Information
Participants are invited to stay after the workshop for the Python Working Group, which meets every Friday from 3:00-4:00 p.m. At the working group, you can ask additional questions, pick anÂ online tutorial to try from our curated list, and meet other researchers learning the language!
