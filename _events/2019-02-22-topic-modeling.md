Discover latent topics across hundreds of texts! This workshop will guide participants through the process of building topic models in the Python programming language. We will start with a discussion of different techniques used to build topic models, following which we will implement and visualize custom topic models with sample data.

Participants who wish to follow along for the hands-on component should bring a laptop with the <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/' target='_blank'>Anaconda distribution of Python 3</a> installed. We will be executing code from a Jupyter notebook. No prior Python experience is required. For help installing Anaconda, stop by the DHLab's Office Hours Monday through Thursday from 2:00-3:00pm.

This workshop is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited. To register, please visit the <a href='http://schedule.yale.edu/event/5144061' target='_blank'>YUL Instruction calendar</a>.

Instructors: Douglas Duhaime (DHLab) and Joshua Dull (Digital Scholarship)
