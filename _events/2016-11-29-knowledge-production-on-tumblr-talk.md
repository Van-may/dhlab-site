Jen Jack Gieseking’s research project explores transgender culture production, medical knowledge exchange, and social network development on the social platform Tumblr in trans people’s own words and images. Drawing on text and social network analysis, he has analyzed over one million #ftm public posts collected daily over the last two years, and in this talk, he will discuss the application of digital humanities methods and approaches to the study of everyday trans life. As a central meeting place for transgender people across nations and generations, these materials help to inform our understanding about the first simultaneous, international production of a gender identity.

Series Organizer: T.L. Cowan (Presidential Visiting Professor, WGSS and the Yale Digital Humanities Lab).

Sponsored by the Yale Digital Humanities Lab, Women’s, Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies &amp; Yale Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies
