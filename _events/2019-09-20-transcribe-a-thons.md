### Overview
Are you curious about Yale’s theater history? Are you a speedy typist? Do you love looking at old ads? If the answer is yes, join us for one—or both—of the <a href='http://ensemble.yale.edu/#/' target='_blank'>Ensemble@Yale</a> Transcribe-a-thons!

Drop in anytime to contribute to the project, enjoy snacks, and play Ensemble@Yale bingo! Help the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory and Haas Arts Library collect actor and staff names from over 900 Yale School of Drama and Yale Repertory Theatre programs. 

**Please bring a computer with you to the trascribe-a-thon.** Both events are open to the entire Yale community and public. 

Can’t make it in person? We’ll be livestreaming the initial demo on the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/YaleHaasArtsLib/' target='_blank'>Haas Arts Library Facebook</a> and <a href='https://www.instagram.com/haasartslibrary/' target='_blank'>Instagram</a> around 2:15 p.m.!
