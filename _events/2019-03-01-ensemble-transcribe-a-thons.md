Help record Yale's theatrical history by participating in an upcoming *Ensemble@Yale* Transcribe-a-thon. Back by popular demand, we will also have rounds of Yale Drama Trivia at the conclusion of each event.

Premiering in 2017 with over 12,000 pages of archival theater programs that span 1925-2016, <a href='http://ensemble.yale.edu/' target='_blank'>*Ensemble@Yale*</a> is an experiment that aims to transform historic programs into searchable text through crowdsourced transcription. 

With your help, we will be able to answer questions about Yale’s theatrical history, such as: “what is the most-produced play at Yale?” or “which actors have played Hamlet on our stages?” With more transcriptions, we will also be able to create network visualizations that more comprehensively represent the history of Yale theater.

All are invited to participate. Join in person or remotely for some or all of the time.

*The transcribe-a-thons are co-sponsored by the Yale Haas Family Arts Library and Yale Digital Humanities Lab.*
