The Digital Humanities Working Group (DHWG) at Yale is delighted to announce a call for co-conveners for the 2017-2018 academic year.

The DHWG is organized by Yale graduate students and focuses on the digital humanities broadly defined, from data mining, online preservation, and teaching with technology to digital mapping, the use of geographic information systems, data visualization, and digital publishing.

Co-conveners and attending students will have the opportunity to collectively determine the format and number of meetings for the year, which might include a regular reading and discussion group, guest lectures from DH scholars at other institutions, or workshops/tutorials on specific tools and software. This year's meetings will be held at the DH Lab, which will also be able to provide additional support for some events.

If you are interested in serving as a co-convener for the DHWG, please email [Andrew Brown](mailto:andrew.s.brown@yale.edu?subject=DHWG) and [Kate Needham](mailto:kate.needham@yale.edu?subject=DHWG) no later than **Friday, October 6** with your name, degree year, program, and a few sentences describing your experience with or interest in the digital humanities. No prior expertise is necessary, and all are invited to apply! Please also feel free to circulate this call to other colleagues who may be interested.
