This workshop will familiarize you with key issues in data visualization. In addition to covering the fundamental principles behind effective visualizations, we will also touch on common pitfalls that result in confusing or misleading graphics. During the workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience using Tableau — interactive, data visualization software — to produce dynamic, compelling visualizations for all kinds of data.

Registration is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited. Lab computers and sample data will be available for use.

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (DHLab), Joshua Dull (Digital Scholarship), and Sarah Tudesco (YUL)
