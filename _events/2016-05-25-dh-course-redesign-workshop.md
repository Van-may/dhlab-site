Interested in exploring how you might incorporate DH methods and tools into the classroom to change the way your students interact with and think about humanities materials? Please join members of the Center for Teaching &amp; Learning and the Yale Digital Humanities Lab for the "Integrating Digital Humanities" workshop, part of the upcoming Course [re]Design Institute series. In the workshop, we will discuss when and how an instructor might rework an existing assignment (or create a completely new one) to include a DH component. Please bring a syllabus or class assignment on which you would like to work to the session. Lunch will be provided.

To sign up, please email Yvette Barnard in the CTL at [yvette.barnard@yale.edu](mailto:yvette.barnard@yale.edu).

Instructors: Carol Chiodo (DHLab), Catherine DeRose (DHLab), and Gideon Fink Shapiro (DHLab)
