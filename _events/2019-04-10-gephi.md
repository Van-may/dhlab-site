This workshop will provide a broad overview of network analysis. In addition to covering what networks are, how to read them, and why you might want to use them, we'll also demonstrate how to generate them using the open-source software Gephi. During the workshop, participants will learn how to construct node and edge lists, import them into Gephi, and export them using a variety of plugins designed for sharing your network over the web.

Sample data will be provided at the workshop, but participants are welcome to bring their own data for discussion at the end.

Participants are required to bring a laptop with <a href='https://gephi.org/' target='_blank'>Gephi</a> already installed to the workshop.

This workshop is open to Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited.

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (DHLab) and Joshua Dull (Digital Scholarship)
