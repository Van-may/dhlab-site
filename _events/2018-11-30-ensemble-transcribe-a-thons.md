<a href='http://ensemble.yale.edu' target='_blank'>Ensemble@Yale</a> premiered last year with over 12,000 pages of archival programs held by Yale from 1925-2016. It is an experiment that aims to transform historic programs from Yale School of Drama and Yale Repertory Theatre into searchable text through crowdsourced transcription.

With your help transcribing digitized programs, we will be able to answer more questions about Yale’s theater history, such as: “what is the most-produced play at Yale?” or “which actors have played Hamlet on our stages?”

You can be a steward of this history by joining the Yale Haas Family Arts Library and Digital Humanities Lab for one or more transcribe-a-thons. All are invited to participate. Join in person or remotely for some or all of the time.
