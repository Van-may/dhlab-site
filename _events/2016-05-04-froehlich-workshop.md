This text mining workshop will overview several ways of interacting with the Early English Books Online-Text Creation Partnership (EEBO-TCP), a full-text transcription database of 25,000 early modern printed books between 1470 and 1700. We will cover strategies for accessing EEBO-TCP, identifying specific transcriptions, tracing specific words/concepts, identifying and modernizing variant spellings, curating subcorpora, and using these resources in a pedagogical context.

In advance of the workshop, please <a href='http://corpus.byu.edu/eebo' target='_blank'>sign up for an EEBO account</a> and <a href='http://cqpweb.lancs.ac.uk' target='_blank'>register for CQPweb</a> with a Yale email address, if you have one.

Registration is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited.

*This is part two of a two-part series with Heather Froehlich, a historical sociolinguist from the University of Strathclyde. Both events are sponsored by the Yale Digital Humanities Lab.*

### Bio
Heather Froehlich studies social identity in Early Modern London plays (1514-1662) and EEBO-TCP Phase I at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK), where she is also a research assistant on the Visualizing English Print (1470-1700) project (a collaboration between Strathclyde, UW-Madison, and the Folger Shakespeare Library). Her work draws on socio-historic linguistics and corpus stylistics, though she sustains an interest in digital methods for literary and linguistic inquiry. Read more about her and her research on her blog or on twitter (@heatherfro).
