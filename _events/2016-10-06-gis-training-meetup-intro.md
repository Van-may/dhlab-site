Interested in working with maps? Looking to learn GIS fundamentals at your own pace? Join the Yale Digital Humanities Lab and GIS Services during this GIS Training Meetup. Esri, a leader in GIS software, has created an interactive, online course that introduces the basics of geographic information systems. During the GIS Training Meetup, participants will work through the course in a group setting, with the GIS Librarian and DHLab staff on hand to assist with questions.

Once you complete the training session, you will be able to:
 * Define GIS
 * Differentiate between vector and raster data
 * Navigate a GIS map
 * Query the map for location and attribute information
 * And more!

Lab computers will be provided, but please bring headphones for listening to the video components.

After registering for a free Esri account, the training video may be accessed anytime from <a href='http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=catalog.webcoursedetail&amp;courseid=2500' target='_blank'>Esri's website</a>.

Space for the meetup is limited.

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (DHLab) and Miriam Olivares (GIS)
