How might a network graph provide context for course syllabi? What could a digital humanities workshop in a class look like and offer? During Office Hours, three Digital Humanities Fellows from fall semester will present on digital activities—from Omeka exhibitions on Latin American history to topic models of the *Slavic Review* journal—that they integrated into their English, History, and Slavic Studies undergraduate courses.

All are welcome to attend; coffee will be provided!

For more information on current and past DH Fellows, visit our <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/about/teaching_fellows.html' target='_blank'>DH Fellows page</a>.The deadline for applying to be a fall 2017 Fellow is Monday, April 3.

Kimberly Quiogue Andrews (English), "Countercultures"
Carlotta Chenoweth (Slavic Languages and Literatures), "Avant-Gardes and Émigrés: Digital Humanities Lab"
