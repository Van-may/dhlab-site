<h2>August 15 and 16</h2>

Please join us for a two-day Library Carpentry Workshop to learn how to:
- automate repetitive, boring, and error-prone tasks
- create, maintain, and analyze sustainable and reusable data
- work effectively with IT and systems colleagues
- better understand the use of software in research  
and much more.

Library Carpentry introduces participants to the fundamentals of computing and provides a platform for further self-directed learning. This workshop series will introduce 'Tidy Data,' OpenRefine, UNIX Shell, and Python. We encourage participants to bring their own laptops, but lab computers will be available. 

*This workshop series is sponsored by Digital Scholarship Services. It will not be recorded, but session materials will be available at <a href='https://nesclic.github.io/2018-08-15-YUL/' target='_blank'> the workshop GitHub page</a>.*

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (Digital Humanities Lab), Joshua Dull (Digital Scholarship), and Kate Nyhan (Medical Library)
