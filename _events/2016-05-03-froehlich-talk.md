In her talk, Heather Froehlich will explore how to use the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary and Early English Books Online-Text Creation Project (EEBO-TCP) Phase I to understand the language of madness in two subsets of early English print: firstly, in a selection of 336 dramatic works (1514-1662) and secondly in 25,000 transcriptions of early English books. She will demonstrate how to harvest historically relevant terms from the Historical Thesaurus and then apply them to EEBO-TCP. In doing so, she has identified different lexical references to madness, with a clear division in use of the 4-word phrase 'I am not mad' in dramatic and non-dramatic writing.

Coffee will be provided! This event is open to the public.

*This is part one of a two-part series with Heather Froehlich, a historical sociolinguist from the University of Strathclyde. Both events are sponsored by the Yale Digital Humanities Lab.*

### Bio
Heather Froehlich studies social identity in Early Modern London plays (1514-1662) and EEBO-TCP Phase I at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK), where she is also a research assistant on the Visualizing English Print (1470-1700) project (a collaboration between Strathclyde, UW-Madison, and the Folger Shakespeare Library). Her work draws on socio-historic linguistics and corpus stylistics, though she sustains an interest in digital methods for literary and linguistic inquiry.
