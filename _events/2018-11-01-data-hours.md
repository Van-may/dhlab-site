Are you a humanities student with questions about data collection, management, analysis, or visualization? Join us for a special drop-in Data Office Hours! This is an opportunity to ask all your pressing data questions, learn about new tools for working with data, and hear about the data resources offered in the library. A group of information experts from across the library will be available to discuss your data issues.

Topics up for discussion include but are not limited to: 
  - Organizing your collection of archival images
  - Keeping track of articles you encounter during your research
  - Finding open data online 
  - Preparing your data for analysis
  - Visualizing your data with out-of-the-box tools
