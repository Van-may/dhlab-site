### Overview

Workshop Grants support digital humanities discussions and training opportunities on campus. Funds up to $500 might be applied toward honoraria and travel expenses for non-Yale participants and/or food for attendees.

Past examples: Recipients have brought guest speakers to campus to offer training in a variety of digital humanities methods, from TEI to mapping.
