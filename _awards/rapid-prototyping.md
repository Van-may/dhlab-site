### Overview

Rapid Prototyping Grants support focused design and development interventions to help a digital humanities project get started or to add an innovative feature to an existing project. <strong>These grants are intended to produce prototypes in the truest sense of the word: something that is the first of its kind and is a working model rather than a production-ready system</strong>. Example types of support include requests for a single view of an interface, a visualization, or high-level mockups.

Have a project in mind but not sure if it's a match for these grants? Stop by the DHLab during office hours to discuss with our team!
