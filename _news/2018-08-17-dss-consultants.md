**Priority Application Window Closes: Monday, September 17, 2018**

Join our team of Digital Scholarship Consultants and work alongside staff in the Yale Digital Humanities Lab and <a href='http://statlab.yale.edu/' target='_blank'>StatLab</a>!

Whether you use field surveys to predict the outbreak of civil wars, machine learning to find aesthetic patterns in 18th-century paintings, interactive data visualizations to track instances of textual reuse in Classical literature, or big data technologies to identify systemic drivers of gene expression, we want to hear from you. We invite applicants who have experience with data of any kind, from surveys, text, assays, and pixels to networks, experiments, simulations, and audio recordings.

Digital Scholarship consultants are members of the Digital Scholarship Services team and work out of the DHLab and the StatLab to provide support for disciplines across the Yale University community. The DHLab offers consultations, workshops, and grants to support scholars using computational methods to pursue humanistic inquiries. The StatLab provides support for data analysis through instruction, consultation, and collaboration.

Digital Scholarship consultants have the opportunity to work with either group or both, depending on their interests and experience.

We are looking for graduate students who:
- have completed most of their humanities, statistics, geospatial statistics, or data analysis related coursework
- can comfortably operate as one of our experts providing instruction, consultation, and/or project collaboration
- are skilled in appropriate software and have the necessary computing knowledge to help others
can commit to at least two hours each week during the semester (there is ample opportunity to work more)
- are interested in developing instructional materials and training workshops for the support of digital research methodologies and data literacy in the Yale community

Specific duties can vary, but you should expect:
- to meet with Yale community members from the undergraduate level to the faculty level and provide guidance on how they should proceed given their subject area, background, and timeline
- to use your expertise on specific digital humanities, statistics, spatial statistics, or data analysis topics and act as a point person for related questions
- to hone your teaching skills by having the opportunity to develop and lead workshops on topics related to your expertise

What do our consultants get?
We pay our graduate students an hourly rate competitive with teaching fellowships and more than other university jobs. In addition to time spent providing 1-on-1 support, we pay our consultants to develop and teach workshops, attend other workshops to sharpen their own skills, and work with faculty and librarians on projects.

Beyond pay, our consultants report that answering questions and problem-solving with our clients helps them retain and sharpen their own skills. Working with researchers from other disciplines can lead to interesting and collaborative experiences that may extend beyond the consulting team's work.

Want to apply?
If you are interested in joining one of the teams, please send an email of intent to [digitalscholarship.services@yale.edu](mailto:digitalscholarship.services@yale.edu).

This email should include a few sentences about your background, the reasons you would be a good addition to the team, and a current CV (PDF format) as an attachment. We'll be in touch and move the process forward from there.

Please send your email of intent by Monday, September 17th for consideration. Applications received after this will be considered on a rolling basis subject to openings on the team.
