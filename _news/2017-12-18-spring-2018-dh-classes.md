  **Spatial Humanities and Social Justice**
  WGSS 717

This seminar introduces students to the theory and methods of the spatial humanities, while examining the tools, theories, and methodologies of social justice. Engaging with spatial theory and applying technical methodologies, students develop an understanding of the research questions and tools available in this new field of scholarly and applied inquiry while grappling with issues of social justice. Students engage throughout the term in project-based learning grounded in spatial, intersectional, and critical race theories.
