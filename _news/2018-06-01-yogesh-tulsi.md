The Digital Humanities Lab is delighted to welcome Yogesh Tulsi to the team as a summer DH intern. Along with creating dynamic video reels to showcase DH work at Yale, Yogesh has also undertaken a project to visualize the networks of a transnational Swiss firm during the late nineteenth century.

Yogesh is a rising junior at Yale-NUS College. His academic interests include film, queer, and postcolonial studies, particularly in literary and historical studies. He plans to use his time in the lab to learn about the ways he can complement his research interests with digital methodologies. Stop by the lab to welcome Yogesh!
