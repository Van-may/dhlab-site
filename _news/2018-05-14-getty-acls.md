Nadya Bair has been awarded an inaugural Getty/ACLS Postdoctoral Fellowship in the History of Art "for a project that will make a substantial and original contribution to the understanding of art and its history." Bair is currently a Postdoctoral Associate with the Yale Digital Humanities Lab and American Studies.

During the Fellowship, Bair will complete *The Decisive Network*, a monograph that examines the history of the international picture agency Magnum Photos. Based in extensive archival research, the project shows how American editors, publishers, and corporate leaders worked with peripatetic photographers to create an American visual culture that was deeply engaged with everyday life around the world. For more on Bair's project and the Getty/ACLS Fellowship, please visit <a href='http://www.acls.org/research/getty.aspx?id=13501' target='_blank'>the program's website</a>.

Congratulations, Nadya!
