  The New York Times covered Yale Law student Nina Varsava's project that uses text mining to analyze the prose style of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch.
---
What kind of writer is Justice Neil Gorsuch? *The New York Times* recently covered the work of Nina Varsava, a Yale Law and Stanford PhD student, who turned to quantitative methods to answer that question and more. Varsava tracked Gorsuch's "stylistic proclivities" from the past decade by quantifying published opinions from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. To read her findings, download Varsava's paper <a href='https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3166538' target='_blank'>"Elements of Judicial Style: A Quantitative Guide to Neil Gorsuch's Opinion Writing,"</a> forthcoming in *NYU Law Review Online*.

*This project was funded with a Yale Digital Humanities Lab Seed Grant.*
