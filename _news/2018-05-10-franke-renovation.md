The Yale Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) will be moving! Currently located on the third floor of Sterling Memorial Library, the DHLab will soon relocate to its permanent home on the first floor, with construction already underway to transform the Franke Family Reading Room into the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory. Through the generous support of the Goizueta Foundation and Richard ('53) and Barbara Franke, the renovated lab will contain flexible workstations, high-definition monitors, and a glass research cube equipped for digital humanities computing. Staff offices will be located in an adjoining annex space, and digital humanities books will line the shelves in the main room, acting as both a reference collection and source for inspiration.

The Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory is set to open in Fall 2018. For more on the upcoming plans, read <a href='https://news.yale.edu/2018/03/19/renovation-creating-new-home-yale-librarys-digital-humanities-lab' target='_blank'>YaleNews's coverage of the renovation</a>.
