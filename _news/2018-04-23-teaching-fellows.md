  Apply to be a Digital Humanities Teaching Fellow for the 2018 Fall semester.
---
Do you want to integrate digital humanities methods into your teaching? Apply to be a DH Fellow! Each semester, the Digital Humanities Lab appoints one or more DH Fellows to assist with courses that have a strong digital humanities component. These positions provide semester-long support for graduate students to engage with digital humanities methods and theories in a classroom setting. DHLab staff will work with Fellows to design digital humanities assignments, arrange access to electronic content, and provide specialized technical training.

Graduate students from all departments are eligible to apply. No prior DH experience is required.
