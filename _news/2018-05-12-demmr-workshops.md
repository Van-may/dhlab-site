  Yale students traveled to Emory University and the University of Pennsylvania to help teach the basics of TEI and markup languages.

*The Digital Editing and the Medieval Manuscript Roll* (DEMMR) project had a busy spring semester, collaborating with Emory University and the University of Pennsylvania to hold two workshops. At both events, participants learned the basics of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and markup languages, considered the complexities of digital editing, and tackled the challenges of medieval manuscript rolls as a form.

The Emory workshop focused upon a genealogical roll that is nearly 22 feet long. The roll, which was donated by an anonymous benefactor, contains a genealogy of English kings and features early modern continuations that were sewn on after the roll’s production. The roll will join several other genealogies in a growing collection of editions, including Takamiya MS 35. The workshop welcomed fourteen participants from various institutions. It was organized by Jenny Bledsoe and taught by James Eric Ensley, Elizabeth Hebbard, Gina M. Hurley, and Annie Killian.

The University of Pennsylvania workshop, which welcomed nine graduate students and librarians, focused on a devotional roll containing Middle English and Latin prayers. Upon its completion, the edition will be one of several in the digital collection focused upon devotional materials, including the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library Osborn a14. Ensley and Hurley traveled to Philadelphia to lead this course, which was organized by Aylin Malcolm and Judith Weston. University of Pennsylvania PhD students Matt Aiello, Nathalie Lacarrière, and Mariah Min also taught several sessions of the workshop.

These events were followed by a one-day workshop at Indiana University, led by James Eric Ensley and Elizabeth Hebbard, and our first ever Advanced Workshop, led by Dana Kovarik Key, Calum Cockburn, Agata Zielinksa and Lauren Rozenberg at University College London.

All of these events, which have been offered free of charge to participants, are part of a larger series of digital editing workshops. So far, well over one hundred graduate students have taken the course, which has been held at Yale University, University College London, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, Emory University, and the University of Pennsylvania. The collaborative editions produced will be gathered in a single database: *Rolls and Scrolls after the Codex: English Manuscript Rolls 1200-1600*.

In early April, Ensley and Hurley unveiled a beta version of the project’s Edition Visualization Technology (EVT), based upon <a href='http://vbd.humnet.unipi.it/beta/#104v' target='_blank'>The Digital Vercelli Book</a>, at the Yale Digital Humanities Lab's third annual *Beyond Boundaries: A Symposium of Hybrid Scholarship at Yale.*. Additional presentations took place at the International Medieval Congress in Kalamazoo, MI, where Hurley and Joe Stadolnik gave talks about the project. Additionally, two panels, sponsored by the program, gathered colleagues and former workshop participants to discuss the peculiarities of manuscript rolls and fragments.

*DEMMR is made possible by the continued support of the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory, the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, and the Medieval Academy of America, as well as by the generosity of collaborating institutions.*
