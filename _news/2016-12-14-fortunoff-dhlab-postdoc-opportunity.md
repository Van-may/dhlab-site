### Fortunoff-DHLab Postdoctoral Associate

The Yale Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies (FVAHT) and Digital Humanities Lab are excited to invite applications for a joint Postdoctoral Associate position for the 2017-2018 academic year. In this position, the Postdoctoral Associate will pursue independent digital humanities research and experiment with tools to explore, analyze, and visualize the Fortunoff Archive.

The Postdoctoral Associate will have a dedicated workspace in the DHLab in Sterling Memorial Library; the opportunity to collaborate with technical staff, including a DH Developer and UX Designer; and a budget for computing equipment, professional development, and relocation expenses. **The Postdoctoral Associate's primary responsibility will be to his or her own research project.** The Fortunoff-DHLab Postdoctoral Associate will work alongside two additional Postdoctoral Associates in the lab.

### About the Fortunoff Archive

With more than 4,400 testimonies—over 10,000 hours of videotape—the [Fortunoff Archive](http://web.library.yale.edu/testimonies/about) includes first-hand experiences of the Nazi persecutions, including individuals who had been in hiding, survivors, bystanders, resistants, and liberators. Testimonies are recorded in whatever language the witness preferred, and they range in length from one-half hour to over 40 hours (recorded over several sessions).

Each testimony is represented by a bibliographic record with an extensive summary and LC subject headings that reflect the survivor’s experiences, the places and camps at which they were located, individuals of historical importance they encountered, and specific subject and thematic elements of their life story. In addition to bibliographic records, each testimony is accompanied by a timecoded index that is contains a summary of the testimony narrative. These indexes are all in English. While transcripts do not currently exist for the collection, the Fortunoff-DHLab Postdoctoral Associate would be provided with a budget to create transcripts for portions of the collection, if necessary for their project.

**For more information and to apply, please visit our [Postdoctoral Associates](http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/postdoctoralassociates) page. Applications are due by 5:00pm on February 20, 2017.**
