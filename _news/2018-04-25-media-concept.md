### Primary investigator (PI)
Anna Shechtman, Graduate student, English Literature and Film & Media Studies

### Job description
The PI is looking to hire a computer programmer to work part time (10-20 hours a week) on a project that will last from May-August at the rate of $20/hour. This work will be used for a digital humanities project that is focused on tracking the evolution of language and ideas in a large corpus of American magazines, 1950-2000. Along with contributing to cutting-edge research in the fields of digital humanities and cultural analytics, the selected applicant will also have a chance to learn more about machine learning and natural language processing. They will also have a chance to build up CS project credentials; the code produced will be potentially used by a large number of later users.

### Tasks
The selected applicant will be asked to:

1. Write code in a virtual machine environment powered by Ubuntu
2. Parse and wrangle large amounts of textual data (books), turning what is rather
unstructured data into highly structured data
3. Run "off the shelf" algorithms on this data to produce output

### Qualifications
An applicant will ideally be:
- a highly proficient programmer in a commonly used language; the PI's preference is for coding to be done in Python
- comfortable working in Ubuntu

Familiarity with text mining and machine learning is not required but is a plus; the selected applicant will not be writing algorithms from scratch.

### Job details
Payrate: $20/hour
