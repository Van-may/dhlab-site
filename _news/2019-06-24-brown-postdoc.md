Andrew S. Brown ('19, English) has been named a 2019-2020 CLIR Digital Humanities Network Postdoctoral Fellow with the Jackman Humanities Institute at the University of Toronto.

While at Yale, Brown was actively involved in numerous digital humanities initiatives. He participated in the Mellon-funded "Graduate Concentration in the Digital Humanities" year-long course and served as a co-convener of the Digital Humanities Working Group. In 2017, he was awarded a DH Teaching Fellowship with the Yale Digital Humanities Lab to integrate digital humanities methods into a class on the Gothic novel. 

During his fellowship, Brown will work on "Water, Waste, and Rising Seas in the Early Modern Atlantic World," a project that uses text mining and mapping tools to track how the inhabitants of the early modern Atlantic world developed a new conception of water as a crucial form of infrastructure: that is, as an urban resource that must be carefully managed, and which could also be fatally corrupted. The project puts particular pressure on those sites and moments when environmental and climatic disruptions appear to threaten this infrastructure.

Congratulations, Andrew!
