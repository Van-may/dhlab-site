### Fellowship opportunity to digitize Dickens

The Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library will be funding a graduate student fellowship, the official announcement of which is on the Graduate School's website. This fellowship will support the development of a website that will make widely available a digitized selection of the manuscripts, first editions, unique art objects, and memorabilia in its Gimbel Dickens collection. Elizabeth Frengel, head of research at the Beinecke , is collaborating on this project with Janice Carlisle, Professor of English. They are soliciting statements of interest from graduate students who would like to be considered for the position.

The graduate student chosen to hold this fellowship will curate materials for online presentation by choosing items to be digitized, compiling meta-data, and writing brief descriptions of and commentaries on such items. Yale graduate students who will be in their fourth, fifth, or sixth years in 2017-2018 are eligible to apply. The fellowship would replace a regular teaching appointment, and it will require approximately fifteen hours of work per week on a schedule more flexible than that of a teaching assignment. No experience designing or building websites is required, though knowledge of Dickensâ€™s life and writings would be helpful.

Please let [Elizabeth Frengel](mailto:elizabeth.frengel@yale.edu) know as soon as possible if you are interested in this opportunity, which would give you experience in one form of digital humanities and in the work of a rare-books collection. [Janice Carlisle](mailto:janice.carlisle@yale.edu) would be also happy to talk with anyone who would like more information about this fellowship.
