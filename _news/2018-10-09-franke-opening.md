Be among the first to visit the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab), the newly renovated nexus for cutting-edge research in the humanities by Yale faculty, staff, and students.   
 
Generously funded by Barbara and Richard Franke '53 and the Goizueta Foundation, the DHLab is located just inside and to the left of the main entrance to Sterling Memorial Library. The lab will open to the public on Oct. 9 in conjunction with the University’s <a href='https://foundersday.yale.edu/' target='_blank'>Founders Day</a> celebration and the Yale Library’s annual open house.
 
Once a stately reading room, the new space features the latest computing technology, a panoply of high-definition screens, and a massive glass walled-cube together with the room’s original, intricately carved woodwork, stained glass windows, and lofty ceilings. Visitors are invited to interact with recent projects, peruse the Digital Humanities Reference Collection, and check out the glass Special Projects Cube, purpose-built for high-performance computing.
 
During the same 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. time frame, visitors are invited to stop by <a href='https://web.library.yale.edu/news/2018/09/library-will-host-open-house-founders-day-oct-9-2018' target='_blank'>20 open house exhibits</a> highlighting different aspects of the Yale libraries set up throughout the Sterling Nave. Several displays focused on the Library’s support of digital scholarship will be in the DHLab, and the Library’s Bibliographical Press — just inside and to the right of the main entrance of Sterling — will host demonstrations on printing as pedagogy.

The whole event is free and open to the public. For more on the DHLab's renovation and opening, visit <a href='https://news.yale.edu/2018/10/04/new-home-yales-digital-humanities-lab-opens-oct-9-sterling-library' target='_blank'>YaleNews</a>.
