### Training Scholarships for 2017

Interested in learning how to build a database or code with R? Apply for a Digital Humanities Training Scholarship! Yale  undergraduates, graduate students, and librarians are eligible to apply. These scholarships support participation in week-long DH workshops.

For more information, visit our [Training Scholarships](http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/trainingscholarships) page. Not sure which workshop is right for you, check out our [Off-Campus Workshops](http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/offcampusworkshops) page or send us an email at [dhlab@yale.edu](mailto:dhlab@yale.edu)!

Courses at the [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](http://www.dhsi.org/) (DHSI) are already beginning to fill up, so we recommend applying now. A second round of DHLab Training Scholarships will be available in the spring for workshops that don't yet have their schedules posted.
