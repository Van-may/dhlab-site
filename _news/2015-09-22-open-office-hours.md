The Digital Humanities Lab invites you to Digital Humanities Office Hours this (and every!) Tuesday, from 2:00pm-3:30pm. We meet in the new DHLab space in Sterling Memorial Library, room 316. Office Hours are an informal opportunity to see the lab, enjoy coffee and conversation, and meet the staff, students, and researchers of the new DHLab. All are welcome!

The DHLab offers space, community, and resources for Yale faculty and students who are working with digital data and methods to address humanities questions. Staff will be available to help at any stage in a project — from conceptualization to implementation — and the lab space itself provides a hub on the Yale campus for sustained Digital Humanities conversations and research.
