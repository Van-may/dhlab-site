### Call for Papers
We are delighted to invite proposals for the inaugural Connecticut Digital Humanities Conference (CT DH), which will take place at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut on February 28-29, 2020. 

CT DH endeavors to bring to together a network of practitioners committed to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy across the New England region. CT DH will provide individuals across New England who are interested in digital humanities with an opportunity to learn new techniques and skills, hear about their colleagues’ projects, and become part of a vibrant and diverse community of scholars and practitioners. We especially welcome proposals that address digital humanities & teaching.

We invite contributions from faculty researchers, unaffiliated scholars, librarians, technologists, and undergraduate and graduate students. We encourage those proposing sessions to consider formats beyond the traditional 20-minute paper panel, such as roundtables, multi-speaker panels, lightning talks, and digital demonstrations. Proposals should be less than 300 words in length and should describe the 
1. proposed topic, 
2. session format, 
3. requested time length, 
4. names and affiliations of participants, and 
5. anticipated audience for the session.

**Proposals are due October 1, 2019. Presenters will be notified of acceptance in November.**
