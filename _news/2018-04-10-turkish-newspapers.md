### Primary investigator
Mustafa Yavas, Graduate student, Sociology

### Job description
This position is for web scraping op-eds from 15-20 Turkish newspapers, dating between April 2012 â€“ September 2017. The aim is to create a database of op-eds that include 5 dimensions: author name, date, article URL, the op-ed title, and the op-ed text. The person who is hired will be expected to include documentation to go along with the web-scraping code.

### Progress-to-date
There is already a Python script that was used to successfully scrape one newspaper. This code will serve as a benchmark script that will need adjustment for each particular newspaper's website (particularly for the HTML parsing portion of the task). Scraping will be performed for each newspaper's website separately.

Here is an example of the URLs to be scraped:
- <a href='http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/tum-yazarlar/' target='_blank'>A list of op-ed contributors in a newspaper</a>
- <a href='http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/ahmet-hakan/' target='_blank'>All op-eds written by an author</a>

### Qualifications
Applicants should ideally have a familiarity with:
- Python (R is also fine, as long as the applicant has web scraping experience in R)
- HTML (HTML parsing experience is a plus)
- Data formats like .csv
- Text encoding (ASCII, UTF, etc.)
- JavaScript is a plus, but not mandatory

### Job details
Closing date: June 15, 2018

Payrate: $20/hour
