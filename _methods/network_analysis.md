### Overview

Networks offer a dynamic way to study things (often referred to as 'nodes' or 'vertices') and the relationships between them (called 'edges' or 'arcs'). Nodes can be anything, from people, places, and books to concepts or words, and they can have attributes like gender or year of publication that you could encode via color, size, or another visual channel to discover patterns. For instance, you might study how character networks differ by genre, gender, or another cateogry, asking questions like how Shakespeare's characters link to one another differently in the comedies versus the tragedies.
