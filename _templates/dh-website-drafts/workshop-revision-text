The Yale Digital Humanities Lab leads workshops throughout the year on methods and tools related to data collection, cleaning, mining, visualization, and analysis. These workshops are open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but sometimes space is limited, so please check to see if registration is required.

For upcoming and past workshops, please visit our Events’ page.

Couldn’t make a workshop? Most of our tutorials are posted to the DHLab’s GitHub Repository.

While the DHLab is always expanding our workshop offerings in response to requests from Yale researchers and trends in digital humanities technologies, below is a list of core workshops we teach throughout the year.

Getting Started Workshops are designed to provide introductions to particular methods and/or tools. These are foundation-setting workshops. When these sessions are part of a sequence, they will be listed as “First Steps” and “Second Steps.”

Topical Workshops focus on a specific technique and assume some prior experience. These are meant to advance your expertise.
