  <p>Yale undergraduates, graduate students, and library staff are eligible to apply. These scholarships cannot be awarded for training opportunities that are fully funded without the scholarship, and you may only receive one DHLab Training Scholarship per year.</p>

  <p>If awarded a scholarship, you will be expected to give an informal presentation in the Digital Humanities Lab that summarizes what you learned so that others can benefit from your experience.</p>
