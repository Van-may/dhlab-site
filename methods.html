    <p>When beginning a digital humanities project, first articulate your research question(s) and then decide how and what technology can best help you answer that question.</p>

    <p>To scope out your research question and determine whether algorithmic approaches would be meaningful, stop by the Digital Humanities Lab during Office Hours. We will be happy to discuss your project and some of the methods and tools that might be appropriate.</p>
