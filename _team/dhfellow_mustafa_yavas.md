Mustafa Yavas is a PhD candidate in Sociology. His work explores the working life of Turkish upper-middle class people and their pathways to the elite labor force in Istanbul and other global cities such as New York City and London. He is also working on a project funded by DH Seed Grants that attempts to map the field of political opinion in contemporary Turkey and its change over time. He combines network and automated text analysis to analyze the competing discourses in newspaper columns about the Gezi Park Resistance, a nation-level uprising that shook Turkey in the summer of 2013. 

As a DH Fellow, Mustafa is working with Professor Alka Menon on the course “Methods of Inquiry” to introduce simulation modeling and social networks analysis and discuss their application in empirical sociological research.
