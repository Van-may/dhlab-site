Jacinda Tran is a third-year PhD student in American Studies. She is interested in how technologies of warfare circulate through the racial formation and representation of Southeast Asian refugees after the Vietnam War. Her work also examines the intersections of US militarization and memory construction in the spatialization of violence. 

As a Digital Humanities Fellow, Jacinda is working with students in Professor Laura Wexler’s course on “Visual Kinship, Family, Photography” to curate and exhibit found, formed, and forged family albums on digital platforms such as Omeka.
