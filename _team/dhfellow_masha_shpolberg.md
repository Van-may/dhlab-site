Masha Shpolberg is a PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature and Film & Media Studies. Her dissertation focuses on the representation of labor in Polish cinema between 1968 and 1989, a time of massive workers' strikes and opposition to the communist government. This historic period was marked by an effervescence of documentary film production in much of the former Soviet bloc. Accordingly, Masha’s dissertation examines the various uses documentary was put to during this period. Her research interests include the history and theory of Eastern European cinema and the evolution of documentary film form more broadly.

In 2015-2016, Masha was awarded a Mellon Fellowship to participate in a year-long Graduate Concentration in Digital Humanities, and that summer she travelled to the University of Victoria to take an intensive workshop on digital storytelling at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute. Masha is excited to work with Professor Charles Musser this fall to integrate interactive documentary and digital storytelling practices into the curriculum of Yale’s long-running Documentary Film Workshop.
