Amanda is a dual-masters graduate student at Yale University, studying both East Asian and American Studies. Her work integrates ethnographic research with digital and visual methods of representation. As a researcher and filmmaker, Amandaâ€™s previous work focuses on marginalized communities in different contexts. Before coming to Yale, Amanda spent several years working in fine art at both the Guggenheim and Peggy Guggenheim Museums. She holds a dual degree in art history and political science.

As a DH Fellow for Professor Laura Wexler's "American Public Sculpture: History, Context, and Continuing Significance," Amanda will work with students to develop their own mapping projects.
