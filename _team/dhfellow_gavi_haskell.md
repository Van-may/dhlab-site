Gavi Levy Haskell is a third-year PhD student in the History of Art. She studies narrative art and visual depictions of interiority in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century British painting. She has previously worked in museum technology, and is interested in the ways digital platforms can support public access to art and art history. 

As a Digital Humanities Fellow for Professor Jacqueline Jung’s course “Art and Architecture of the Sacred: A Global Perspective," Gavi will join Nathalie in helping students explore visual and geographic themes with digital tools.
