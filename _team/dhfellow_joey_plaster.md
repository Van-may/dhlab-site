Joey Plaster is a doctoral candidate in American Studies. In his dissertation project, he draws on methods from performance studies and ethnography to explore the politics of queer "street youth" who migrated to and between central city districts in the United States, from the 1960s through the 2010s. The recipient of the American Historical Societyâ€™s 2010 Allan Berube Prize for work in public history, Plaster has been a Martin Duberman Visiting Scholar at the New York Public Library and a fellow at the Center for Gay and Lesbian Studies at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. 

As a Digital Humanities Fellow, Plaster is working with Professor Angel Nieves to develop his course "Spatial Humanities and Social Justice." Course participants will use digital humanities tools to map New Haven's queer and black histories.
