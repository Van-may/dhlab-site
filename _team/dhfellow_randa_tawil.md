Randa Tawil holds a BA in American Studies from Wesleyan University. Before beginning her PhD, she worked as an ethnographic consultant in Denmark, working on projects in Japan, Russia, the US, and the UK. Her research interests focus on migration and diaspora studies, critical race theory, and Arab American racial formations.

The "Narrating the Lives of Refugees" course draws upon the the emerging field of critical refugee studies in order to critically analyze contemporary representations of refugee experiences across genres and to help students develop narrative strategies which represent refugees as agents and historical actors. Students will pay special attention to the processes by which war, colonialism, displacement, encampment, gender, and racialization shape the lives of refugees in New Haven and beyond. The students will take this knowledge and conduct their own interviews with people with refugee status living in New Haven. In the process, students will learn to use digital tools like StoryMaps to create compelling, multidimensional stories about the people they interview.
