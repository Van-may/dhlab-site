Amanda Joyce Hall is a doctoral student in History and African American Studies. Her dissertation is a grassroots history of the international movement against South African apartheid that attends to the ways in which the internal resistance dialogued with freedom struggles across the world.  As a Digital Humanities Fellow, Amanda aims to develop digital tools that redress the lives and experiences of those who are most silenced and marginalized in the archive. She treats digital humanities as an opportunity to explore interdisciplinarity, reach broader publics, and develop alternate epistemologies. At present, Amanda is creating a DH project that uses ESRI tools to map the life of Pauli Murray during her fellowship period in Professor Crystal Feimsterâ€™s "The Long Civil Rights Movement" lecture course.  

Amanda holds an AB in Classics from Dartmouth College and an MSc in teaching from Fordham University. She received a dual-Masters in International History from Columbia University and London School of Economics. Her scholarship is made possible through the generous support of the Ford Foundation, the Mellon Mays Foundation, and the Falk Foundation fellowships.
