Nichole Nelson is a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the History Department. Her dissertation examines how small suburban communities that choose to intentionally racially integrate in order to increase their property values can serve as potential models to achieve racial residential integration nationwide, in light of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) missed opportunity to achieve integration during George Romney’s tenure as HUD Secretary from 1969 through 1973.  

As a Digital Humanities Fellow, Nichole looks forward to working on the New Haven Building Archive (NHBA) for Professor Elihu Rubin’s class, "American Architecture and Urbanism." She will help students research the history of a building using archival documents, city directories, photos, building permits, and maps, and upload their research to the New Haven Building Archive’s website. Nichole also hopes to expand the website by developing tours and writing introductions to these tours and to create community-based partnerships to expand the NHBA beyond the academy into the community.
