Tyler is a PhD candidate in Physics, where he studies statistical and nonlinear dynamics. His dissertation work centres on modeling unexpected behaviours that arise when a fluid flow interacts with a squishy porous medium. He maintains a long-standing interest in probing sites of symbolic and methodological interchange between literature and the natural sciences. 

As a Digital Humanities Fellow, Tyler is thrilled to be working with Professor R. John Williams on the course "Literature and the Future, 1887 to the Present," exploring digitally-informed modes of reading as both a mirror upon and exercise of literary futurity.
