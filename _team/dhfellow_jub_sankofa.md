jub Sankofa​ is an artist and community organizer. Currently, jub is completing his joint PhD in the American Studies and African American Studies Departments, with a concentration in Public Humanities (specifically public history, community memory, digital humanities, and documentary studies). jub’s research and teaching interests explore the United States carceral regime—the juvenile and adult criminal legal systems—at the intersections of race, history, and law. In 2016, jub received a Seed Grant from the Digital Humanities Lab at Yale to support his digital storytelling project, “Geographies of Survival: Black Mobility, Labor, and Professionalization of the Carceral State, 1915-1945.” The project is a digital representation of jub’s dissertation and uncovers the migrations of black itinerant laborers and black sex workers, tracing their lives out of the US South into the American West. 

As a DH fellow, jub is working with Professors Laura Wexler and Angel Nieves to facilitate “Intro to Digital Humanities,” a course that gives students experience with digital humanities methods and combines various disciplinary approaches to humanities-based research. Students will critically engage with digital methods to explore historical, cultural, social, and political humanities questions through the lens of power, privilege, and access. jub will consult and  teach students how to create StoryMaps for their final projects. Collectively, students will construct digital StoryMaps on three topics related to Yale’s institutional history: Black Panther trials in New Haven, Calhoun College, and Co-Education at Yale.
