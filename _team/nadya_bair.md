A historian of photography and the press, Nadya Bair holds a PhD in Art History from the University of Southern California. Her book project, *The Decisive Network: Magnum Photos and the Postwar Image Market*, examines the role of photo agencies in shaping postwar visual culture. Based on years of research in over a dozen archives around the world, *The Decisive Network* looks beyond heroic photographers and their iconic images to demonstrate how a range of professionals brought the aesthetic and production mode of news images into multiple markets for photography. Bair has published articles in the journals *History of Photography* and *American Art*, and in the edited volumes *Getting the Picture: The Visual Culture of the News* and *Visualizing Fascism* (forthcoming). At Yale’s Digital Humanities Lab, Bair will be mining data from thousands of pages of Magnum business correspondence in order to visualize and analyze the full scope of the agency’s networks. Working on a scale that exceeds the limits of chronological and linear narrative, this project will model new ways to study image saturation and the collaborative labor that yielded it.
